# TinkerTailor

"Tinker, Tailor,
Soldier, Sailor,
Rich Man, Poor Man,
Beggar Man, Thief!"

This is an old English children's rhyme for counting out one of the players. Let's make this rhyme abstract!

It is a K-long sequence of syllables after all, and play this game repeatedly: N children stand in a circle, and they count from 1 to K starting from Player #1. This time Player #K gets excluded. They continue counting from the next player, #(K+1), and after each round one player leaves the circle. After N-1 rounds there will be one player standing, who wins the game.

The outcome of this game for N and K is the sequence of the excluded numbers. For example, in case of N = 5, K = 3 the solution is [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]. In a more verbose form:

starting from 1 --> [1 2 3 4 5] --> 3 is out -->
starting from 4 --> [1 2    4 5] --> 1 is out -->
starting from 2 --> [   2    4 5] --> 5 is out -->
starting from 2 --> [   2    4   ] --> 2 is out --> [4] wins

Write an algorithm that gives the outcome sequence for arbitrary N and K parameters.
